## âœ… Problem 1: Reverse Last K Words in a String
### ðŸ“‹ Description
Implement a normal stack of char then implement a function that takes a **string** and an **integer `k`**, and **reverses the characters of the last `k` words** in the string, without changing their positions.

- Words are separated by a single space.
- Only the **last `k` words** should be reversed.
- Reversing a word means reversing the **characters** within that word, not the word's position in the sentence.
- The function must modify the string **in-place**.

### ðŸ“¥ Input
- A string `s` (e.g., `"Hema is the goat"`)
- An integer `k` (e.g., `3`)

### ðŸ“¤ Output
- The modified string with the **last `k` words reversed** by character.
